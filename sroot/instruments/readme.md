# Instruments schema set

Schemas unique to instruments. Each instrument should be a
schema group in a child folder.

This scheme set will not have a "shared" folder until
common patterns appear within the instruments groups. It
maybe groups by technique are added here so can be reused
by any instrument schema.

## Available schemas for instruments

* **None** Placeholder, likely to be one per instrument (or technique)
