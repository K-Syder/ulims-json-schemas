# Zdemo practice folder

This folder provides a location to create new
schemas manually or by copying the empty schema
into this folder. This file is the only thing in
this folder tree that should be committed
to this repository.

**If any folder or file is committed here
they will be deleted without notice.**

## Using a copy of empty schema
Note the instructions on the readme.md for the empty
schema. In particular, the need for certain parts
to match some of the folder tree structure.
