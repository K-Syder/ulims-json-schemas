# For top level schemas built from sets of allOf references
# it is worth letting jsonschema-tools generate the
# example. It will include all "required" properties from
# all schemas. The file checkpy.datafile contains
# a copy of the top 0.0.1 example.
#
# Therefore, the following have been commented out. 
#
#examples:
#  - comment: "Example showing required data values in top 0.0.1"
