# Faster child

This schema will have many point releases compared to all
others. Parents ignore these changes until ready. The
release frequency is beyond the recommended amount but
gives a safe place to confirm systems ignore the change.

## Changes

* **0.0.1** - Start of faster child used by all 0.0.1 parents
* **0.0.2** - First point release with changed properties.
