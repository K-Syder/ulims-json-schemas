# Faster child

This schema will have many point releases compared to all
others. Parents ignore these changes until ready. The
release frequency is beyond the recommended amount but
gives a safe place to confirm systems ignore the change.

## Changes

* **0.0.1** - Start of faster child used by all 0.0.1 parents
* **0.0.2** - First point release with changed properties.
* **0.0.3** - Changed properties for build-modified detection
* **1.0.0** - Property about_faster2 was optional now required
* **1.0.1** - New property which topfast 1.0.0 will use.
