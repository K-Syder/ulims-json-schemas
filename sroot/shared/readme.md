# Shared schema set

A common set of schemas that provides the highest 
level of reuse across all schema sets, systems
and applications.

Schema sets or groups should provide their
own "shared" folder if the schemas they define
are not expected to be reused outside of
themselves. If common patterns appear in those
shared folders they are expected to migrate
into this folder over time.
